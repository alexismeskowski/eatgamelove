    "text": "Hi! My name is Alexis Meskowski (AKA theRealActualToilet) and I’m a Health Coach and Educator. I’ve always been passionate about finding a balance between all areas of wellness and everyday life.\nI’m also a huge gamer with ADHD so finding that balance can be difficult sometimes! It would be nice to have someone there to encourage and plan through starting new changes without feeling judged. Luckily I have learned how to cultivate growth for healthy change in my life alongside my interests and I would like to help others do the same!\nIt’s my mission to help online gamers find areas of their personal wellness that need attention and use their natural strengths to develop simple action plans for lasting change, improving their overall health, well-being, and confidence."

    "text": "📝 Free Consultation\n\n\n\n\n\nA free 20-30 minute meeting where I can introduce myself, share more about my coaching style, and see how I can help you to create the kind of change you are looking for. We can discuss the length of coaching you would like to receive (usually 12 weeks) and what the cost will be. If you think coaching would be a good fit for you then we can move on to schedule some health coaching sessions!\n\n\n🥊 Health Coaching\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have completed a free consultation and decided that health coaching seems like a good fit for you, we can begin a health coaching agreement. We’ll meet virtually for 45 minutes to 1 hour once a week to discuss goals, challenges, feelings, and develop an action plan for the week that you can feel good about. Evidence suggests that change occurs best with a 12 week program so I will always recommend our agreement lasts 12 weeks.\nEvery week we’ll work together through your action plan and make adjustments as you navigate incorporating healthy changes into your life. I will be here to support you without judgement and with unconditional positive regard towards you and your health goals. By the end of the 12 weeks you will be able to say that you made a positive commitment towards your health and it will be satisfying to look back at how much you have grown.\n\n\n🌈 Dimensions of Wellness\nI take a holistic approach to health and wellness, using the 6 dimensions of health recognized and defined by the National Wellness Institute. As we make a coaching agreement I will send you a simple health assessment using these areas of wellness to give a good idea of your strengths and areas we can look to improve.\n\n\n\n\n\n💪Physical Wellness - The consistent prioritization of physical self-care and the engagement in a variety of health-enriching behaviors.\nex: walking, tennis, yoga, managing medications, stretching, flossing, etc\n🧘‍♂️Spiritual Wellness - The development of an appreciation for the depth and expanse of life and natural forces that exist in the universe.\nex: journaling, quiet time, nature walks, meditating/praying, etc\n🧠Intellectual Wellness - The creative, stimulating activities that lead to learning, personal growth, and the sharing of one’s unique gifts with others.\nex: reading, painting, playing DnD, cooking, etc\n🙋‍♀️Social Wellness - The contribution to one’s environment and community with an emphasis on the interdependence between others and nature.\nex: coffee with friends, discord community night, joining a club, gaming with friends, etc\n💻Occupational Wellness - The personal satisfaction and enrichment one receives in life through their employment, academic, or volunteer work.\nex: volunteering at the food pantry, taking your work breaks, taking a class, doing homework, etc\n🎭Emotional Wellness - The awareness and acceptance of one’s feelings and the capacity to manage behaviors related to one’s emotional state.\nex: sleeping, body scan meditations, gratitude exercise, therapy sessions, etc"

    "text": "Frequently asked questions. If you have a question that I haven’t answered or you would like more info, you can always feel free to send me a message over Discord and I would be happy to help you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🙋‍♂️ What is health coaching?\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth coaching is a partnership between coach and client to see areas for health improvement, develop a plan for change, and work through that change on a regular basis. I meet with clients once weekly for 12 weeks in order to help you brainstorm, encourage your natural strengths, listen to your challenges, and help you to find a change that works for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🤷‍♀️ How can coaching help me?\n\n\n\n\n\nCoaching can help you to have the motivation and confidence needed to make a healthy lifestyle change that works for you. Maybe you are having trouble getting enough sleep every night, especially when your favorite new game just dropped. I can help you work through your strengths, focus on a plan, and confidently catch some Z’s.\nI’m passionate about holistic wellness and can help with a wide range of health goals, even if you are unsure of where you would like to start. By the end of our 12 weeks together you will be more self-assured and capable to continue making healthy change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🎮 Do I have to be a gamer for you to coach me?\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely not! Whether you play video games or not I would still love to coach you. I market my services towards gamers because I can personally relate my lifestyle to others in the hobby but I will never gatekeep my services from someone that is interested in being coached by me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🎓 What are your qualifications as a health coach?\n\n\n\n\n\nI received my certification as a Health Education Specialist (CHES) in 2019 and recently received my certification as a Wellness Practitioner (CWP) in September of 2023. I also completed a training program in Health and Wellness Coaching through the National Wellness Institute and am looking to fulfill the session requirements to become a board certified health coach.\nI have always wanted to help people on an individual level and I’m committed to continuing to learn and grow through hands-on sessions as I continue in my journey as a health coach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📄 Are your services covered by health insurance?\n\n\n\n\n\nMy services are not currently covered under health insurance so I do my best to keep that in mind when setting prices for my coaching agreements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🤔 How is health coaching different from therapy?\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth coaching can be a great addition to your overall wellbeing but does not replace the role of a therapist.\nAs a health coach I focus on improving your health through lifestyle changes like sleep and exercise, while a therapist focuses on addressing mental and emotional wellbeing, treating things like anxiety and depression. I have certifications as a Wellness Practitioner (CWP) and a Health Education Specialist (CHES) as well as being trained in health coaching to help clients achieve specific health outcomes. Therapists have advanced degrees and offer psychotherapy focusing on specifically mental health."
